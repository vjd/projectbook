We have mentioned rmd_files in Section 1.3, and there are more (optional) settings you can configure for a book in _bookdown.yml:

book_filename: the filename of the main Rmd file, i.e., the Rmd file that is merged from all chapters; by default, it is named _main.Rmd.
before_chapter_script: one or multiple R scripts to be executed before each chapter, e.g., you may want to clear the workspace before compiling each chapter, in which case you can use rm(list = ls(all = TRUE)) in the R script.
after_chapter_script: similar to before_chapter_script, and the R script is executed after each chapter.
edit: a link that collaborators can click to edit the Rmd source document of the current page; this was designed primarily for GitHub repositories, since it is easy to edit arbitrary plain-text files on GitHub even in other peopleâ€™s repositories (if you do not have write access to the repository, GitHub will automatically fork it and let you submit a pull request after you finish editing the file). This link should have %s in it, which will be substituted by the actual Rmd filename for each page.
rmd_subdir: whether to search for book source Rmd files in subdirectories (by default, only the root directory is searched).
output_dir: the output directory of the book (_book by default); this setting is read and used by render_book().
clean: a vector of files and directories to be cleaned by the clean_book() function
